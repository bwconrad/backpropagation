Implementation of backpropagation network written in python3. The single hidden layer network implements a 2 variable XOR gate without the use of any libraries.

User can choose learning rate and number of epochs for the training.

The network achieves an error of 2.5e-5 after 1e4 epochs with a learning rate of 10.
